# The_Basel_Problem

The Basel problem is about finding the total value of adding together a bunch of numbers, where each number is the fraction 1 divided by a whole number squared. For example, if you add 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + 1/(4^2) + ..., and you keep going forever, what would be the result? This problem puzzled mathematicians until Leonhard Euler discovered that the answer to this infinite addition is exactly equal to π (pi) squared divided by 6. 

As an avid mathematician, I found this problem highly intriguing, prompting me to investigate it personally. To do so, I implemented a for loop that accumulates the sum of these numbers. Surprisingly, upon reaching the solution, I realized it equates to π squared divided by 6. I proceeded by multiplying this final sum by 6, then taking the square root, expecting to obtain the value of π. Directly below this outcome, I printed the true value of π for a side-by-side comparison with my Basel Problem-derived result.
